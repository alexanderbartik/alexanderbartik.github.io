## About me

- I'm an economist at UIUC who studies labor markets, urban economics, and cash transfers.  I live in Illinois with my wife and three children.

### About this site

- I made this site using the base Jekyll theme called Minima. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).  
- It is hosted on github pages.
- I also used some ideas from [Jonathan McGlone](https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io) and [Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham](https://github.com/paulgp/paulgp.github.io)
